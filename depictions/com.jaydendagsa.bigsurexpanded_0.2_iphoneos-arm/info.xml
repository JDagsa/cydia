	I have bumped up the version to 0.2 and removed it from beta,<br/>
	since I have added a lot of new stuff to this theme, including a dock and settings icons.<br/>
	Thank you to those who have downloaded this theme, and love it. It is an honor to<br/>
	be making something that people love, so thank you. I'll be keeping BSE<br/>
	free and open-source (you can get the project through my GitHub repo down below).<br/>
	 <br/>
	Here are the new stuff loaded in this theme!<br/>
	• Settings icons for stock iOS, Accessibility and Shuffle<br/>
	• A dock based on Big Sur's light mode dock<br/>
	 <br/>
	Icons that were changed:<br/>
	• Wallet<br/>
	 <br/>
	Icons that were added:<br/>
	• Videos (for earlier versions of iOS)<br/>
